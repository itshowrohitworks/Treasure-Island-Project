# Treasure-Island-Project
*Treasure Island* is a text-based adventure game in which players make decisions to navigate a fictional island and ultimately find hidden treasure. The game guides players through a series of choices, each with unique outcomes, including winning or losing the game. The journey includes decisions like choosing directions, waiting for a boat, or picking doors of different colors, each leading to different scenarios such as discovering treasure or encountering peril.

# Steps Involved:

## 1. Welcome Message

Players are welcomed to "Treasure Island" and informed of their mission: to find the treasure.
First Choice – Crossroad

Players encounter a crossroad where they decide to go either "left" or "right."
If they choose "right," they fall into a hole, ending the game.

## 2. Second Choice – Lake

If players choose "left," they reach a lake with an island in the middle.
They decide to "wait" for a boat or "swim" across.
Choosing to "swim" results in an attack by a trout, leading to a game over.

# 3. Third Choice – Doors

If players wait for the boat, they arrive on the island safely and find a house with three doors in red, yellow, and blue.
Choosing "yellow" leads to the treasure and victory.
The "red" door reveals a room full of fire, and the "blue" door leads to a room of beasts, both resulting in a game over.

# 4. End Messages
Players receive humorous messages after each decision, providing a playful tone throughout the game.
